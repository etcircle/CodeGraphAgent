| **`calculate_cyclomatic_complexity`** | Measure function complexity. | "What is the complexity of `main`?" |
| **`find_most_complex_functions`** | List the hardest-to-maintain functions. | "Show me the 5 most complex functions." |
| **`find_dead_code`** | Identify unused functions. | "Find dead code, but ignore `@route`." |

## System & Management

Tools for managing the graph and background jobs.

| Tool Name | Description | Natural Language Example |

| **`unwatch_directory`** | Stop monitoring a folder. | "Stop watching `src`." |
| **`list_indexed_repositories`** | Show what projects are currently indexed. | "What repos are indexed?" |

## Bundles & Registry

| Tool Name | Description | Natural Language Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`search_registry_bundles`** | Find shared graphs in the cloud. | "Search for a `flask` bundle." |
| **`load_bundle`** | Install a graph bundle. | "Load the `flask` bundle." |

## Advanced Querying

For complex questions that standard tools can't answer.

| Tool Name | Description | Natural Language Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`execute_cypher_query`** | Run a raw read-only database query. | "Find all recursive functions." |
